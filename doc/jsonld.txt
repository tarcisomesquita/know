your sitemap includes only web page URLs, you can provide Google with a simple text file that contains one URL per line. For example:

https://www.example.com/file1.html
https://www.example.com/file2.html

Guidelines for text file sitemaps

    Encode your file using UTF-8 encoding.
    Don't put anything other than URLs in the sitemap file.
    You can name the text file anything you wish, provided it has a .txt extension (for instance, sitemap.txt).

Break up large sitemaps into smaller sitemaps: a sitemap can contain up to 50,000 URLs and must not exceed 50MB uncompressed.
Use a sitemap index file to list all the individual sitemaps and submit this single file to Google rather than submitting individual sitemaps

Google does not pledge to crawl every URL in a sitemap.

Describe your page with unique titles and snippets

Às vezes, o Google usa a tag <meta name="description"> da página para gerar um snippet de resultado da pesquisa.

 Por exemplo, a metadescrição a seguir oferece informações detalhadas sobre um livro, e as informações são claramente marcadas e separadas:

    <meta name="description" content="Escrito por U.M. Autor, ilustrado por V. Gogh, Preço: R$ 17,99, tamanho: 784 páginas">
